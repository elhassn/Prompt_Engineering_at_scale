# Prompt_Engineering_at_scale
Prompt Engineering at Scale â€” Summary
ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
The notebook demonstrates how to scale prompt engineering using Azure OpenAI, enabling teams to evaluate and iterate on prompts efficiently across different inputs.

ðŸ§± Key Components:
1. Setup & Configuration
Imports necessary libraries (openai, pandas, tqdm, etc.)

Configures connection to Azure OpenAI using:

python
Copy
Edit
openai.api_type = "azure"
openai.api_base = "<AZURE_ENDPOINT>"
openai.api_version = "<API_VERSION>"
openai.api_key = "<API_KEY>"
2. Dataset
Loads a CSV file containing sample inputs (e.g., customer queries, instructions).

Each row represents a prompt input to be tested.

3. Prompt Templates
A base prompt template is defined using Python's .format() style:

python
Copy
Edit
prompt_template = "Given the input: {input}, generate a response."
The template is dynamically filled with rows from the dataset.

4. Batch Inference
Uses openai.ChatCompletion.create() to run prompts at scale.

Iterates over each prompt/input from the dataset and collects model outputs.

5. Response Storage
Results are stored in a pandas DataFrame along with the original input and the model's response.

Can export results to a CSV for offline analysis.

âœ… Benefits Highlighted:
Scalability: Test multiple prompts in batches.

Template Reusability: Change prompt templates easily.

Automation: Minimal manual intervention needed.

Evaluation Ready: Ideal for systematic A/B testing or human evaluation.
